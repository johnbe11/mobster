# Component-level SBOM update via the augment commands

Build-time SBOMs generated by Konflux can be further augmented, to include
information that is only known during a Konflux release, after the
`push-snapshot` Task. This information comes from a "mapped snapshot spec"
file, created by the `apply-mapping` task in a Konflux release pipeline.
Examples include OCI image tags or the image's release repository.

You can perform the augmentation via the mobster command: `augment oci-image`.

## Augment oci-image
You can either augment a specific OCI image by providing the optional
`--reference` argument, or augment SBOMs for all images in the supplied
snapshot:
```bash
$ mobster augment oci-image --output sboms/ oci-image \
    --reference quay.io/repo/image@sha256:<digest> \
    --snapshot snapshot.json

$ mobster augment oci-image --output sboms/ oci-image \
    --snapshot snapshot.json
```

## Augmentation examples
Here is an example of what gets updated by `mobster augment oci-image`. The
following example uses the SPDX-2.3 format and a single-arch image. Let's
assume we have the following snapshot spec file:
```json
{
  "components": [
    {
      "name": "mobster-demo",
      "containerImage": "quay.io/redhat-prod/mobster-demo@sha256:<digest>",
      "rh-registry-repo": "registry.redhat.io/mobster-demo",
      "repository": "quay.io/redhat-prod/mobster-demo",
      "tags": ["1.0", "latest"]
    }
  ]
}
```

The following is an excerpt from the build-time SBOM, specifically the SPDX
package for our single-arch component:
```json
{
  ...
  "SPDXID": "SPDXRef-image",
  "externalRefs": [
    {
      "referenceLocator": "pkg:oci/mobster-demo@sha256:<digest>?repository_url=quay.io/redhat-user-workloads/mobster-demo",
      "referenceType": "purl",
      "referenceCategory": "PACKAGE-MANAGER"
    }
  ]
  ...
}
```

We can now run the command:
```bash
$ mobster augment oci-image --output sboms/ snapshot \
    --snapshot snapshot.json
```

Mobster now parses the snapshot and fetches the build-time SBOM of all the
images in it using `cosign`, based on the `containerImage` field. It then
parses SBOM the SBOM and updates it with the data provided in the snapshot.
That same package in the SBOM will look this after the augmentation:
```json
{
  ...
  "SPDXID": "SPDXRef-image",
  "externalRefs": [
    {
      "referenceLocator": "pkg:oci/mobster-demo@sha256:<digest>?repository_url=registry.redhat.io/mobster-demo&tag=1.0",
      "referenceType": "purl",
      "referenceCategory": "PACKAGE-MANAGER"
    },
    {
      "referenceLocator": "pkg:oci/mobster-demo@sha256:<digest>?repository_url=registry.redhat.io/mobster-demo&tag=latest",
      "referenceType": "purl",
      "referenceCategory": "PACKAGE-MANAGER"
    }
  ]
  ...
}
```
Notice that an additional ref was added to account for two tags and the
`repository_url` field in the PURLs was updated with our release repository.
